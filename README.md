**Java Fundamentals**

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

In the javaBasics Package we have the following programs:
DataTypes, Condition Statements and Operators

DataTypes In Java
There are two types of data types in Java: 
1. Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char,
byte, short, int, long, float and double. 
2. Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes,
Interfaces, and Arrays.

Conditional Statements:
1. if-statements
2. switch-statements

Operators in Java:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Modulus (%)

**OOP's Concepts**

In this Package we have the following programs that contain the OOP's concepts:
Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism

- Object-oriented programming helps solve a problem by mapping the real-world object into a program.
- An Object is a physical entity, and it has a state, e.g. height and size of a person. It's an instance of a class.
- A Class is a logical entity, and has/is a type. It is a temple used for creation of objects.
- The reason why it is called Object-Oriented Programming is that we deal with real-world objects that have a state

1. Abstraction (defines a class): Hiding complexity and showing the important things
    - removing any unnecessary information from an object and keeping relevant information only
    - making the class uniquely identified in the system between others
    - helps with garbage removal

2. Encapsulation: A process of binding data (variables) and its behaviour (methods) in a single unit.
    - combination of Abstraction and Encapsulation we get a class.
    - e.g. School bag, phone, ATM, TV, Car

3. Inheritance (is-a): When a child class inherits properties and behaviours form its parent class
    - parent class is also known as a superclass
    - child class is also known as a derived class
    - Bank Account that has a Business Bank Account and a Personal Bank Account is an example of Inheritance
    - common behaviours can be found in a parent class
    - different behaviours can be found in a child class with unique properties

4. Polymorphism: another silent feature in OOPs where a method can take more than one form based on the type of
   parameters, order of parameters and number of parameters
    - it's performed on the methods (behaviours)
    - e.g. a woman can be a daughter, wife, mother and sister at the same time
    - there are two types of polymorphism; method overload and method override
    - method overload is when multiple methods have the same name in the same class, and all methods work differently
    - method override is when the child class has the same method as declared in the parent class
